### Background

The original [repo](https://github.com/makipom/BlueArchive-Cursors) only provides Windows cursor theme. This repo uses [win2xcur](https://github.com/quantum5/win2xcur) to convert `cur,ani` file into xcursor file.  
No new icons are added here.

The release only includes the cursor theme that matches the original one  
`Install - No Static Text Cursor, Cat.inf` (bcuz that’s the one I personally use :)).  
I also added shadows for the static cursor icons.

If you'd like, this repo also includes some helper script for building theme.

#### NOTE

The original theme doesn’t include all cursor icons that a linux cursor theme needs, so you’ll need to set up a fallback in your `index.theme`.
